/* Types of storage, as returned by file_get_storage_info.

   STORAGE_DEVICE is a mach device_t (for random access devices)
   STORAGE_HURD_FILE is a hurd file_t (as if a file were mapped)
   STORAGE_TASK is a task_t (the storage is in the vm of the task)
   STORAGE_MEMORY is a memory object port
   STORAGE_ZERO is a fixed-size constant source of zeros
   STORAGE_INTERLEAVE is a set of other storage types interleaved at a fixed
    interval
   STORAGE_CONCAT is a set of other storage types concatenated end-to-end
   STORAGE_LAYER is a set of storage types, representing the same address
     range; all will be written too, and will be read in turn until one
     succeeds
   STORAGE_REMAP is a layer on top of another store that remaps its blocks
   STORAGE_COPY is a memory snapshot of another store
   STORAGE_NETWORK means that the file is stored elsewhere on the
     network; all the remaining fields contan type-specific information.
   STORAGE_OTHER means none of these apply; and should be used when no
     meaningful answer can be given

   The vectors returned by file_get_storage_info encode each of the above
   (note that the first int is always the storage type).  There are four:
   ports, ints, offsets (loff_t), and data (char); each type of store uses the
   following entries in each vector:

    -type-  -ports-  -ints-	     	     -offsets-	       -data-    -kids-
    device  DEVICE   TY, FL, BS, NR, NL, ML  NR * (OFFS, LEN)  NL + ML   -
    file    FILE     TY, FL, BS, NR, NL, ML  NR * (OFFS, LEN)  NL + ML   -
    memory  MEMOBJ   TY, FL, BS, NR, NL, ML  NR * (OFFS, LEN)  NL + ML   -
    task    TASK     TY, FL, BS, NR, NL, ML  NR * (OFFS, LEN)  NL + ML   -
      (the data for the above is a name (incl '\0') and a misc data block)
    null    -	     TY, FL		     SIZE	       -         -
      (BS is 1)
    ileave  -	     TY, FL, IL, NC	     -		       -         NC
      (BS is the LCM of its children; SIZE is the minimum of theirs * IL)
    concat  - 	     TY, FL, NC      	     -		       -	 NC
      (BS is the LCM of its children; SIZE is the sum of theirs)
    layer   - 	     TY, FL, NC      	     -		       -	 NC
      (BS is the LCM of its children; SIZE is the minimum of theirs)
    remap  - 	     TY, FL, NR      	     NR * (OFFS, LEN)  -	 1
      (BS and SIZE are that of the child)
    copy   -         TY, FL, SIZE	     -		       DATA	 -
      (DATA is preceded by padding to the next page boundary, and is
       SIZE bytes long itself)

  For ileave, concat, and layer, the children are encoded following the parent.
  The first int must always be TY.

  key: TY = type code, FL = flags, BS = block size, NR = num runs,
       NL = name len, ML = misc len, NC = num children,
       IL = interleave (bytes), SIZE = Size of storage (blocks),
       LEN = run length (blocks), OFFS = run offset (blocks),

  The NR * (OFFS, LEN) offsets for some of the types is the set of block
  ranges in the underlying address space that, concatenated, make up the
  contents of the storage -- for instance, doing file_get_storage_info on a
  file may return storage of type STORAGE_DEVICE, and the accompanying block
  ranges are the set of blocks on the given device that correspond to that
  file.  Any OFFS == -1 designates a hole in the address range.  Note that
  the total size (SIZE) for these types is the sum of their LEN's.

  The optional NAME returned by some types (if NL != 0) is a type specific
  name for the same object referenced by the port also returned.  E.g.:
    device -- The mach device name
    file   -- The file name (unreliable, as the root may not be the same)
    task   -- The pid
  Unless it is MACH_PORT_NULL, the port should generally be used instead of
  trying to regenerate it from the associated name, which is intended more for
  printing messages, etc.  */
